Our group plans to interview and observe participants on their observations and behaviors when visiting WCMA. We hope to gain more insight on how to make museums more accessible for people of all ages and regardless of disabilities. These contextual inquiries will improve our understanding of visitor interaction with a museum. 


We plan to use three different participants for our contextual inquiry. First, we plan to interview a Williams student with no expertise in art or museums. We will observe his/her behavior and actions in WCMA, noting their approach/observations of art and navigation of the museum. We will be conducting this interview either 9/30 or 9/31 at WCMA. We will also interview a Williams Professor with young children to look into recent behaviors and experiences with children at museums. Finally, we will interview a staff member at WCMA. This staff member will give us insight into behavioral patterns of visitors. These two interviews will be conducted the week of 10/1 depending on responses via email.
