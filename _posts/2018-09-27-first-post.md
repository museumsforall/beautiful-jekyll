**Muse for All – Team Contract:** 

This team contract describes how we operate as a team. It addresses expectations about: attendance, preparation, division of work, decision-making processes, what the group plans to do about leadership/roles, how disagreements will be handled, how group members will treat each other, and what actions the group will take if the terms of the contract are violated. 

1.	**Preliminary Information.** Each member of the group has varying schedules and work load throughout the semester. We will communicate our obligations and availability via group chat (not Slack). 
2.	**Guiding Principles.** The following principles are descriptions and behaviors and attitudes each member must respect and live by for the group to be successful: 
  a.	Always Communicate – always respond to the group chat, even it is to say “Sorry I am busy and can’t talk now”
  b.	Be flexible and open about rescheduling
  c.	Don’t procrastinate
  d.	Come to meetings prepared
  e.	Be supportive of each other
  f.	If work can’t be completed, communicate with group – work out a solution
3.	**Preliminary focus on purpose.** The overall purpose of our group is to create a project we are proud of and in line with the scope of the project assignment. We are here to learn and practice skills but also want to have fun in the process. 
4.	**Group Roles/Dividing Up Work.** There is no hierarchy or assigned roles. All assignments will be evenly divided by amount of effort. 
5.	**Dividing up the task.** Tasks will be divided by skill and time. Everyone will be given an equal amount of work. We will try to play to people’s strengths and accommodate people’s needs/schedules depending on the week. 
6.	**Developing a team plan.** Team plans will be determined at our weekly meetings. Determining our team plan will include dividing up current tasks and discussing future work. 
7.	**Meeting Management.** We plan to meet in person at least once a week on Thursdays at 11am. If needed, additional meetings will be scheduled and planned via group chat. Each group member must come to the meetings prepared and ready to work. If there is a conflict within the group, communicate in person or via text any concerns/difficulties. 
8.	**Accountability Processes.** Tasks should be reviewed by other members of the team. Be open to critiques and improvements. Deadlines should be set in order to make sure tasks are completed on time. 
9.	**Rewards and Punishments.** Team success should be recognized by all group members when appropriate. When issues of non-performance and failure to meet commitments arise, all group members should have open conversations and act as needed. All group members must be open to feedback, including negative internal AND external comments. 
10.	**Follow-up.** This contract will be revisited and edited as needed.
