**Summary of Key Findings**

**Contextual Inquiry Results** 

_WCMA Curator (interview)_  
We conducted an interview with a curator from WCMA at WCMA. She has extensive background in the incorporation of art into the classroom, specifically helping students and professors engage with artwork in museums. We conducted a semi structured interview, for we had a list of preliminary questions for her. As the conversation unfolded, we asked other questions pertaining to the matter of making museums more accessible for people without revealing that are focus it potentially people of color. It is fascinating that she, herself began to discuss about museums not being “open for all,” a conversation that should be taking place in museums. Moreover, Asking her questions about her background and observations in museums is extremely helpful for our project since she revealed information that may not be obvious to museum visitors and us, the interviewer. She helped shed a light on new perspectives, since WCMA staff are the ones who interact with museum visitors the most (besides art). She was really open to not only talk about herself but also her mother who was a curator at LACMA. Her initiatives to foster discussions about art and redefining who museums should target has given us another puzzle piece to work with. 

**Afinity Diagram**

_High Level Themes_
  * A need for accountability that has resulted from social distrust of museums 
  * Museums, specifically labels and audio recordings need clearer explanations 
  * Users are categorizing museums as uncomfortable spaces, so there is a need to make museums more comfortable for users
  * People are more likely to engage with art if there is a sense of familiarity present 
  * People are also more likely to engage with art if there is a compelling ambiance 

_Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks important to design for?_

Yes, from the affinity diagram we can see that the tasks important for our design include:
  * Figuring out ways museums can better utilize their space

_Process for identifying these themes_

Creating an infinity diagram was no simple task. We first began by looking back at the data we collected from our contextual inquiries and interviews. We only used two different color post it notes for this affinity diagram. We did not want to categorize data based on the different people we interviewed; instead we took a holistic approach. We started off by writing comments and observations from the data we collected. We then began to match the pile of post it notes by lining them up in a row. We then collectively named each row.
