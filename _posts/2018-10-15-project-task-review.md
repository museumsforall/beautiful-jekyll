## Existing Tasks  
**Easy: WCMA holds special discussion space events at WCMA for community members to join, sometimes facilitated by WCMA staff and sometimes facilitated by invited guests.**  

**Easy: Conversations between WCMA staff/representatives and visitors about exhibits through fly-on-the-wall observations, formal solicitations of feedback, and ..Dana  (make more specific)**

**Easy: Visitors create alternative interpretations and critique exhibits during their visit already**

Anna is a young adult and a lover of contemporary art. Her local museum recently announced the opening of a new exhbit she is interested in. As other museum visitors focused on the main painting, she had her eyes on a painting with a simple black dot on the canvas. She was having trouble figuring out what the black dot meant: hope, death, humans? She goes with her first thought; it must be hope. (I will add to both of my paragraphs... also is this what we're supposed to be doing??) 

## Potential New Tasks

**Hard: sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community/those outside of the museum space (at all times?, immediate?, prevent postponing?) Jamie**

**Hard: making the dialogue between museum staff/representatives and visitors easier to access  Dana**

**Hard: making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums**

Maria is a student who rarely visits museums. She finds it difficult to connect with art that doesn't pertain to her culture. On a recent school fieldtrip to an art museum, she felt uncomfortable by an exhibit about Latin American culture. She felt as though her tour guide misinterpreted the images on display. She wonders if she was the only one who felt that way and wishes she could tell others how she felt.
