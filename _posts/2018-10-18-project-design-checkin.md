## Designs 
All of our designs attempt to implement our three new tasks:
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibitions
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA
* Making the dialogue between museum staff and visitors easier to access.
In addition, each of these designs also incorporates one or more existing tasks in a unique way.

### Mobile App
We see the mobile app interface as a great way to get people involved in more long-form discussion relating to the museum and its exhibitions. It's important to us that the app allows people to jump into conversation quickly and to read others' comments without being weighed down too much in menus. We also envision WCMA staff having a presence on the app and using it as an advertising space for upcoming WCMA events. We learned from our research that WCMA holds many discussions with professional facilitators that allow community members to respond to the exhibitions, and recently, this space was used to address issues of cultural appropriation and other concerns. However, we also learned from our research that many of the people who wanted to partake in those discussions did not even know they were going on.

EXISTING TASK: In addition to supporting our new tasks, this design also aims to *support visitors in reating alternative interpretations and critiques of the exhibits during their visit.*

### Museum Installation
In galleries, people can use a museum installation electronic device to share and read thoughts/comments about the exhibit. These thoughts and comments are then displayed in an artistic way on a display at the entrance of the museum. The purpose of the display at the entrance of the museum is to allow users to feel like their comments are contributing and making a different/do not disappear into the ‘void.’ We envision this installation to support our new tasks and the pre-existing task that visitors create alternative interpretations and criticisms. This installation allows for sharing of discussions happening at WCMA (Task 1) as visitors can read comments and discussion forums based on topic on the display at the entrance of the museum and/or at the exhibit itself. The display also facilitates dialogue between museum staff/representatives (Task 2) by allowing users to share feedback and comments and curators to ask questions/leave prompts. Finally, since visitors create alternative interpretations and criticisms, this platform will allow for the sharing and reading of these alternative interpretations (Task 3).

EXISTING TASK: In addition to supporting our new tasks, this design also aims to expand upon visitors’ ability to create alternative interpretations and criticisms.

### Headset and Device
Headset provides more context and information about the exhibits/artists, almost like a guided tour, but users have the option to choose a topic to hear more about. Also describes some of the discussion going on at WCMA/in the community relating to the exhibit. OR Device gives them different options of what they want to listen to. They can also submit their thoughts through the device. They can also hear what comments others have made about the exhibit.
