## Designs 

**Mobile App:**
advertise discussions at WCMA, but primarily, it is a discussion space for people to share their thoughts about the exhibits. When people make a post, it is arranged on a page in a visually compelling way, so people can click on part of an image and go to the comment and reply if they want to.

  * New Task #3: making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations
  * New Task #1: sharing discussions happening at WCMA
  * New Task #2: making the dialogue between museum staff/representatives and visitors easier to access
  * Old Task #3: visitors create alternative interpretations and critique exhibits during their visit already


**Museum Installation:**
outside of galleries, people can use the installation to share their thoughts/comments about the exhibit. They are then displayed in an artistic way on a display at the entrance, maybe, of the museum. Users feel like their comments are a contribution and it doesn’t disappear into the “void”-- others might see it.

  * Old Task: whatever you want

**Headset and Device:**
Headset provides more context and information about the exhibits/artists, almost like a guided tour, but users have the option to choose a topic to hear more about. Also describes some of the discussion going on at WCMA/in the community relating to the exhibit. OR Device gives them different options of what they want to listen to. They can also submit their thoughts through the device. They can also hear what comments others have made about the exhibit.
