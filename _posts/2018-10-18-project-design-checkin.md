## Designs 
All of our designs attempt to implement our three new tasks:
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibitions
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA
* Making the dialogue between museum staff and visitors easier to access.
In addition, each of these designs also incorporates one or more existing tasks in a unique way.

### Mobile App
We see the mobile app interface as a great way to get people involved in more long-form discussion relating to the museum and its exhibitions. It's important to us that the app allows people to jump into conversation quickly and to read others' comments without being weighed down too much in menus. We also envision WCMA staff having a presence on the app and using it as an advertising space for upcoming WCMA events. We learned from our research that WCMA holds many discussions with professional facilitators that allow community members to respond to the exhibitions, and recently, this space was used to address issues of cultural appropriation and other concerns. However, we also learned from our research that many of the people who wanted to partake in those discussions did not even know they were going on.

EXISTING TASK: In addition to supporting our new tasks, this design also aims to *support visitors in creating alternative interpretations and critiques of the exhibits during their visit.*

### Museum Installation
In galleries, people can use a museum installation electronic device to share and read thoughts/comments about the exhibit. These thoughts and comments are then displayed in an artistic way on a display at the entrance of the museum. The purpose of the display at the entrance of the museum is to allow users to feel like their comments are contributing and making a different/do not disappear into the ‘void.’ We envision this installation to support our new tasks and the pre-existing task that visitors create alternative interpretations and criticisms. This installation allows for sharing of discussions happening at WCMA (Task 1) as visitors can read comments and discussion forums based on topic on the display at the entrance of the museum and/or at the exhibit itself. The display also facilitates dialogue between museum staff/representatives (Task 2) by allowing users to share feedback and comments and curators to ask questions/leave prompts. Finally, since visitors create alternative interpretations and criticisms, this platform will allow for the sharing and reading of these alternative interpretations (Task 3).

EXISTING TASK: In addition to supporting our new tasks, this design also aims to *expand upon visitors’ ability to create alternative interpretations and criticisms.*

### Headset and Device
Currently, some museums offer audio descriptions and personalized tours. In this design, we are taking these to create a more engaging design for museum vistors. The wireless headsets in addition to a hand held device similar to a tablet can provide more context and information about the particular piece of art one is standing in front of such as the title of the piece, artist, and other historical context that can help visitors better undertand the art. This is almost like a guided tour, but instead you are in control of what you want to see and what information you want to hear. Users are given different options of what they want to listen to. They are also able to submit their thoughts about a specific piece that left an impression on them. The different options listed aim to perform the tasks we have listed above. This device can facilitate discussions between museum staff and visitors in addtiton to being an easier platform for visitors to share personal thoughts about art. Museum visitors can also use these comments and information to form their own interpretations. 

EXISTING TASK: In addition to supporting our new tasks, this design also aims to *facilitate conversations between WCMA staff/representatives and visitors about exhibits*
