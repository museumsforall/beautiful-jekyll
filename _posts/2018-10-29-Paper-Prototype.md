## Paper Prototype 

### Two Main Tasks
It is important to us, that our prototype addresses the following tasks: 
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community and inviting people to participate as they experience an exhibit
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums


### Overview of Our Design 
Our new design features a 'smart-board'-like interactive display that will be showcased at the front of the museum. Users will be able to interactively choose to learn about exhibits being showcased at WCMA and read about discussions and conversations happening at the museum about the exhibits chosen.

### Home Page
This is our home page, each exhibit currently at the museum is featured. The user picks 'Dance We Must' to view more. The user is automatically taken to the following page to learn more about the exhibit they have chose, in this case 'Dance We Must.'

### Exhibit Detail Page
This is the exhibit detail page. It provides context and history on the exhibit and includes relevant information that is curated by WCMA staff. There is also a word bubble/graphic that depicts topics of discussion and conversations happening at the museum about that particular exhibit. The user can click on a word to see more related content. In this case, the user picks 'Cultural Appropriation.'

### Discussion Popup
Here, pop ups appear on the screen with relevant information on 'Cultural Appropriation.' This includes content curated from WCMA staff highlighting points brought up in in-person discussions happening at WCMA. This also includes content from visitors themselves. Users can contribute to this curated feed by texting comments, thoughts and reactions using thier mobile phones. Here, one of our main tasks is accomplished: 
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community and inviting people to participate as they experience an exhibit

### Mobile Phone Component
In this particular scenario, the user then decides to contribute his/her thoughts on the discussion feed he just read about cultural appropriation. He does so by texting the number given, selecting the correct exhibit/topic and typing up his comment.
Our second task is accomplished: 
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums
