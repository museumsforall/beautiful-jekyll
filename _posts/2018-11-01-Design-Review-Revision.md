## Project Design Review Revision 

After further discussion with Iris about our project design, we decided to change our [museum installation](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-22-Project-Design-Review/) to an interactive smartboard. Some concerns brought up during our discussion were if discussion forums will actually complete the [six tasks](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-15-project-task-review/) we created and if so, is this a creative way of doing it. 

From our brainstorming session, we believe that implementing an interactive smartboard is a more innovative and useful way of making exhibits more acccessible to museum visitors. This board will allow users to learn more about specific artwork/exhibits. Based on the exhibit chosen, a description of the exhibit and a word cloud/bubble will be displayed with certain words associated to the exhibit. Visitors can click on the word, a description of the previous discussions that have occured at WCMA will pop up along with a window with context information and comments. Visitors will be able to read about different topics/conversations and contribute their thoughts by texting them to the number provided. Theses comments sent in via text message will be read by museum staff and added to the preexisting comments/discussion on the board. 

Our [paper proptype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/) has further detail about the components of this design. 

The tasks we chose for each of our new story boards are: 
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community and inviting people to participate as they experience an exhibit
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums

We chose these tasks because it is important for us that we not only are able to faciliate coversations and interpretations happening at WCMA but also be able to address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums as expressed in our second task.
