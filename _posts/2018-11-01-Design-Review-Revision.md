## Project Design Review Revision 

After further discussion with Iris about our project design, we decided to change our [museum installation](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-22-Project-Design-Review/) to an interactive smartboard. Some concerns brought up during our discussion were if discussion forums will actually complete the [six tasks](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-15-project-task-review/) we created and if so, is this a creative way of doing it. 

From our brainstorming session, we believe that implementing an interactive smartboard is a more innovative and useful way of making exhibits more acccessible to museum visitors. This board will allow users to learn more about specific artwork/exhibits. Based on the exhibit chosen, a word cloud/bubble will be displayed with certain words associated to the exhibit. Visitors will also be able to contribute their thoughts by texting them to the number provided. 

Our [paper proptype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/) has further detail about the components of this design. 

The tasks we chose for each of our new story boards are: 
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community and inviting people to participate as they experience an exhibit
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums

We chose these tasks because it is important for us that we not only are able to faciliate coversations and interpretations happening at WCMA but also be able to address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums as expressed in our second task. 


### Task 1: Sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community and inviting people to participate as they experience an exhibit
In this scenario, we have Anne who is visiting an exhibit at WCMA for the third time. She wants to contribute to the discussion and she is able to do so by sending a text. 
 

### Task 2: Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums
Here, we have Bob who is visting the opening of a new exhibit at WCMA. Since it's his first time here, he wants to read other thoughts about the experience. He is able to do so by using this design.
