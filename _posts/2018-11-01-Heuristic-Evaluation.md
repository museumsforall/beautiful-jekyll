In class we conducted two heuristic evaluations of our paper prototypes. For the first heuristic evaluation, Jamie and Elvira conducted the evaluation. Jamie was the facilitator/computer while Elvira observed and took notes. Figure 1 shows the Heuristic Evaluation table completed by the other team.

An overview of the heuristic evaluation table is outlined in Figure 3. Some repeated comments were.... Some improvements to our paper prototype are... An overview of our paper prototype can be seen in Figure 4.
