title: Usability Testing Check-in

## Cognitive Walk-through 
During class we conducted three cognitive walk-throughs to determine if potential users will understand and develop the same conceptual model we have. For our first cognitive walk-through our persona was a museum visitor who reads about the exhibit and is very opinionated about cultural appropriation. His task was to share new comments in response to re-existing comments. During the traversal of the action sequence we dsicovered that it is quite simple to select an exhibit from the homepage of our interactive smartboard. However, when it comes to selecting a word to learn more about (in this case cultural appropration) it is not clear if "word" is an appropriate description for "topic." Moreover, we realized there was no scroll bar for our comment section. For our second cognitive walk-through, our persona was an occasional WCMA visitor who felt ambivalent about the *Dance We Must*. His task was to get more information about a particular exhibit and read about what others have to say. Here, the action sequence was the same. We saw a similar problem with word choice which is why we decided to change "choose a word to learn more!" to "choose a topic to learn more!" on our design. For our final cognitive-walk through we had a persona who was visiting the *Dance We Must* exhibit for the third time and wanted to leave a comment. This walk-through revealed that leaving a comment from the homepage is a doable task. 

### Changes made  
Word Choice: "Choose a word to learn more!"
* Heuristic Violation: Help and Documentation 
* Severity: 2 (// we didn't decide on this in class? Do these seem right? Am I missing another change? Also just realized it has to be a digitized table... will insert one soon!)
