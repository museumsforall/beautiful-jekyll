## Usability Tests 

Over the last week and a half we conducted three usability tests. For the first test, we used our original paper prototype that we created. Then after conducting this first test and a cognitive walk through, we made changes to our prototype and conducted two more usability tests. The results and key takeaways from conducted these tests are outline below. 

**Usability Test 1**
Over the weekend we conducted our first usability test with our paper prototype. We recruited a Williams student who is not in HCI and has no experience or background in art. We conducted the test in Eco Cafe at night when there were not a lot of people. We chose this environment because it was familiar, convenient and comfortable for the participant, as well as undistracting. We thought our participant was a good choice because he has an interest in technology but no background in design.

To start the test we introduced our project with some background about the HCI course we are currently in and a vague description of the goal/purpose of our project. We emphasized the importance of thinking aloud and oversharing his opinions and thoughts during the test. We then read him a simple background story: that he had just gone through the Dance We Must exhibit in WCMA and saw the smartboard on his way out. Then we asked him to complete the first task. Once he completed the first task we asked him to complete the second. Jamie facilitated the test while Dana took notes.

After completing this usability test we learned how a user who is not familiar with our class or background interacts with our product. We realized that key revisions need to be made including clarification of particular headers and clearer response messages. These change are outlined in the table below and further discussed below.

**Usability Test 2**

**Usability Test 3** 

This week we conducted our third usability test with our paper prototype. We recruited a Williams student who is not in HCI and does not have a technical background or experience with art. We conducted the test in Lees on Thursday afternoon where there were plenty of people around but not crowded. We chose this environment because it was familiar and convenient for the participant. We chose this participant because she has no focused background with design or technology. We thought she was a good participant because her lack of technical background would give us some good insight into design. 

We introduced our project with some background about the HCI course and a vague description of our goal and purpose of the project. We emphasized the importance of thinking aloud and oversharing opinions and thoughts during the test. Then we read her a background story: she had just gone through the Dance We Must exhibit in WCMA and saw the smartboard on his way out. Then we asked her to complete the first task: viewing other people's comments on the work. We then asked her to complete the second task: sharing her own comments in response to the work. Dana facilitated the test while Jamie was the computer and Elvira took notes. 

After completing this usability we realized we needed to redesign our content/context pages to be a different layout because putting them side to side makes it slightly confusing. Also she brought up good points that not all people might not have phones and would not be able to contribute to the discussion. She helped us realize that some design and layout revisions need to be made. These changes are outlined and described in the table below.

## Final Paper Prototype 

Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process. Include both:
An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.


**Key Revisions** 

Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be the most salient and important modifications to your paper prototype based on issues identified in inspection, usability testing, or critique. These issues may already be included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.
