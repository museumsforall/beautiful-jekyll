## Usability Tests 

TESTING

Discuss your three usability tests. Provide a description of each test, including the participant, the environment, why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol, and the roles of each team member who participated in the test. Briefly discuss revisions you made in your process and prototype over the course of your testing. Present a table or list of results from your three usability tests. For each critical incident, include:
An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
For negative incidents, the severity of the issue assigned by the team.
For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.

**Usability Test 1**
Over the weekend we conducted our first usability test with our paper prototype. We recruited a Williams student who is not in HCI and has no experience or background in art. We conducted the test in Eco Cafe at night when there were not a lot of people. We chose this environment because it was familiar, convenient and comfortable for the participant, as well as undistracting. We thought our participant was a good choice because he has an interest in technology but no background in design.

To start the test we introduced our project with some background about the HCI course we are currently in and a vague description of the goal/purpose of our project. We emphasized the importance of thinking aloud and oversharing his opinions and thoughts during the test. We then read him a simple background story: that he had just gone through the Dance We Must exhibit in WCMA and saw the smartboard on his way out. Then we asked him to complete the first task. Once he completed the first task we asked him to complete the second. Jamie facilitated the test while Dana took notes.

After completing this usability test we learned how a user who is not familiar with our class or background interacts with our product. We realized that key revisions need to be made including clarification of particular headers and clearer response messages. These change are outlined in the table below and further discussed below.

## Final Paper Prototype 

Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process. Include both:
An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.


**Key Revisions** 

Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be the most salient and important modifications to your paper prototype based on issues identified in inspection, usability testing, or critique. These issues may already be included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.
