title: Digital Mockup
---

## Overview: 
For our museum installation, we used Balsamiq to create our digital mockup. The following show [two important tasks](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/) of our design: 
* Sharing discussions happening at WCMA for the wider community and inviting people to participate as they experience an exhibit
* Making/sharing/reading alternative interpretations of exhibits/works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums

## Task 1

## Task 2 

## Decisions and changes made in implementing the digital mockup:
* We could not implement a "sliding window" feature, which we had simulated in our digital mockup. Instead, one window moves to the left so another can appear beside it in a simple pop-up way.
* We changed the color scheme of our mock-up, seeing that on-screen, the original colors we had were rather unpleasing.
* We also included more colored areas, realizing that the plainness of the paper prototype showed a need for more color contrast in the digitized version
