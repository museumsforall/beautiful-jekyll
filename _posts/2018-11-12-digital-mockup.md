title: Digital Mockup
---

## Overview: 
For our museum installation, we used Balsamiq to create our digital mockup. The following show [two important tasks](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/) of our design: 
* viewing discussions happening at WCMA about particular artworks/ exhibits 
* contributing to such discussions  

## Task 1 

In order to view discussions about particular exhibits happening at WCMA, in this case the 'Dance We Must' exhibit, we start at the 'homepage' of our installation. On this page we can see the different exhibits currently on display at WCMA. The directions state to click on an exhibit to learn more about it. In this case the user will click the 'Dance We Must' exhibit. If the user is having trouble they can click on the question mark on the top right corner which takes to the 'About Muse' page.

Once the user has successfully selected an exhibit, they will be taken to the 'Dance We Must' exhibit page. This page has a word cloud and additional context the user can scroll through. We will have the user select 'Cultural Appropriation' for this task.

The user is taken to the 'Cultural Appropriation' page where they can read additional context. The 'View Discussion' button is at the left of this. If at any point the user does not know what to do next, they can simply click the question icon which takes them to the appropriate pop-up window.

Here, the user can scroll to read the 'Discussion Highlights.' A back arrow and home button are visible for users to return to previous stages.

## Task 2 

## Decisions and changes made in implementing the digital mockup:
* We could not implement a "sliding window" feature, which we had simulated in our digital mockup. Instead, one window moves to the left so another can appear beside it in a simple pop-up way.
* We changed the color scheme of our mock-up, seeing that on-screen, the original colors we had were rather unpleasing.
* We also included more colored areas, realizing that the plainness of the paper prototype showed a need for more color contrast in the digitized version
