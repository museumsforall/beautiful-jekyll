title: Digital Mokcup

## Task 1: Viewing discussion about a particular exhibit 

## Task 2: Contributing to the discussion 

## Decisions and changes made in implementing the digital mockup:
* We could not implement a "sliding window" feature, which we had simulated in our digital mockup. Instead, one window moves to the left so another can appear beside it in a simple pop-up way.
* We changed the color scheme of our mock-up, seeing that on-screen, the original colors we had were rather unpleasing.
* We also included more colored areas, realizing that the plainness of the paper prototype showed a need for more color contrast in the digitized version
