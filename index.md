## Museums for All 

### The Problem
The [literature](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/mellon-foundation-museum-diversity-study-322299) shows that museums are often inaccessible to people of color. Besides the fact that people of color (PoC) constitute such a small percentage of museum staff across the country, we observed directly through our research that the way subject matter relating to PoC issues is handled often leaves PoC feeling uncomfortable, discouraged, or angry. In our community, there is ostensibly a lack of conversation around the local museum's accountability regarding how it handles these issues. However, our team learned that these conversations are actually happening. One challenge is getting the word out, and another is making sure it can have an immediate positive impact on people's experiences in the museum.

### Designing a Solution
We wanted to design something that would help make museums more accessible for people of color, something that visitors could use *while* they were in the museum so that they wouldn't leave feeling negatively. We began researching the problem by holding a series of research sessions with Williams College students and staffmembers from the Williams College Museum of Art. We learned more about the problem, what's at stake, and how the issues we're observing in our local community are reminiscent of a national phenomenon of museum exclusivity.

### Changing the Museum Experience
#### Without Museums For All...
Without Museums for All, there may be no outlet for someone to voice their criticisms of the museum or an exhibit. Without having that platform, we observed our visitors leaving the museum feeling ambivalent at best, but probably angry with the way sensitive issues were handled. We want to intervene on their experience so that their concerns can be addressed and they can find validation in joining an ongoing conversation.

#### *With* Museums For All...
This is where our design comes in. We propose a platform, to be available for use in or near the exhibits, that provides educational material on the social concepts relevant to an exhibit as well as a discussion platform. This museum installation will simultaneously inform museum-goers about topics such as *cultural appropriation*, for instance. This will simultaneously educate visitors and show those who are concerned about the exhibit's subject matter that the issues *are* being addressed, and that other people are thinking about them, too.

Providing educational materials on the issues at hand and promoting discussion are essential facets of our solution.
