### Problem and Solution Overview
Initially, we believed that a discussion forum was the best design for making museums accessible to people of color by maximizing visitor participation and usability. Given the nature of this design, we assumed people would have the tools necessary to voice their opinions about artworks and exhibits. However, after further discussion with Iris about our initial project design, we decided to make our design more educational and interactive to help prevent a recreation of existing power dynamics within the discussion space and provide more learning opportunities for our users. In the end, we envisioned an interactive touchscreen display to be placed at the entrance of an exhibit.

We believe that this change will result in a more innovative and useful way of making conversations and exhibitions more accessible to museum visitors. Users will be able to learn more about specific exhibits and based on which one is chosen, as well as the artworks in that exhibit. Furthermore, the can do this by clicking on a topic related to the museum (for example, "cultural appropriation"), allowing a concerned visitor to zero in on the conversations that feel relevant to them.

Rather than relying on discussion to solve the problems we are designing for, we decided to make our design more educational. The context we provide will be pre-written and could potentially be submitted by community members with a vested interest or specialty in these topics, such as professors, interested students, community organizers, or even WCMA staff. Discussion is then a supplemental component of this, but not the sole or main way that we hope to accomplish our design goals.


### Initial Paper Prototype

For our initial [paper prototype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/), we relied heavily on providing a discussion platform to achieve our goals. We quickly learned, however, that this might not be the best approaach to solving the problem at hand. In the beginning, as you can see in the snippet above, we used our design mainly to direct users to the discussion panel. A supplementary context panel was provided, which we intended to provide an educational write-up for users to read before considering the discussion, but the discussion was still our primary component.


### Testing Process

In order to test our paper prototype, we first conducted [heuristic evaluations](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-11-01-Heuristic-Evaluation/) along with a walk-through of our prototype. We then proceeded to conducting three [usability tests](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-11-09-usability-testing-review/) with people of various backgrounds. 


### Testing Results 

Our usability tests demonstrate that
