### Problem and Solution Overview
Initially, we believed that a discussion forum was the best design for making museums accessible to people of color by maximizing visitor participation and usability. Given the nature of this design, we assumed people would have the tools necessary to voice their opinions about artworks and exhibits. However, after further discussion with Iris about our initial project design, we decided to make our design more interactive. Instead of opting for an ordinary museum installation that serves as a discussion forum, we decided for an interactive smartboard. 

We believe that this change will result in a more innovative and useful way of making conversations and exhibitions more accessible to museum visitors. Users will be able to learn more about specific exhibits and based on which one is chosen, the user has the option of choosing a word from a word cloud that is associated to the exhibit. 

Visitors can click on the word and a description of the previous discussions that have occured at WCMA that are related to the word will appear along with a window with context information and comments. Visitors will be able to read about different topics/conversations and contribute their thoughts by texting them to the number provided. Theses comments sent in via text message will be read by museum staff and added to the preexisting comments/discussion on the board.

Rather than relying on discussion to solve the problems we are designing for, we decided to make our design more educational. The context we provide will be pre-written and could potentially be submitted by community members with a vested interest or specialty in these topics, such as professors, interested students, community organizers, or even WCMA staff. Discussion is then a supplemental component of this, but not the sole or main way that we hope to accomplish our design goals.


### Initial Paper Prototype 

For our initial [paper prototype](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-29-Paper-Prototype/), 


### Testing Process

In order to test our paper prototype, we first conducted [heuristic evaluations](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-11-01-Heuristic-Evaluation/) along with a walk-through of our prototype. We then proceeded to conducting three [usability tests](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-11-09-usability-testing-review/) with people of various backgrounds. 


### Testing Results 

Our usability tests demonstrate that
