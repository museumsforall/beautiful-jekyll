### Design Research Results and Themes 

[Results and Themes](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-04-contextual-inquiry-review/)

Some of the themes present as we were reviewing our research results were accountability and accessibility for a specific group of people, specifically people of color. There is a need for accountability that has resulted from social distrust of museums. From our affinity diagram, clarity is needed when it comes to labels and audio recordings at museums. Users are categorizing museums as uncomfortable spaces, so there is a need to make museums more comfortable. We also discovered that people are more likely to engage with art if there is a sense of familiarity present or if there is a compelling ambience in an exhibit. From these themes, it became clear to us which tasks our design had to accomplish… help users connect with art by making museums more comfortable and centering narratives of people of color by sharing them or making them more accessible. 


### Answers to Task Analysis Questions 

[Task Analysis](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-04-contextual-inquiry-review/)

Though our design is primarily for people of color, we are trying to make the museum installation accessible to everyone. Based on our contextual inquiries and interviews, we were able to discover that PoC may not feel comfortable in museum spaces because of their inability to relate to artwork lacking PoC representation. Currently, museum visitors engage with art in their own ways. They are able to generate alternative representations and communicate those with people they feel comfortable with. They may also engage in conversations with museum staff about artwork they find intriguing. Some museums also make an effort to hold special discussions for community members. For our museum installation, we want people to share and read alternative interpretations of works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums. We also want our design to make accessing discussions between museum staff and visitors more accessible. Sharing discussions happening in museums for the wider community is another task we wish to accomplish. We expect these tasks to be performed in museum spaces, where people can interact with art. We also know that discussions can happen outside of museum spaces. People can learn how to complete these tasks through various ways, some of them being their interactions with other museum visitors and exposure to art they can engage with. As of now, people are able to communicate with other museums visitors but we are lacking other tools for expressing how art makes us feel. Our design will enable users to express their opinions and feelings of discomfort more easily which will also be accessible to others. These tasks are meant to be performed while a user is at a museum. If things go wrong in our design, users will resort to the original form of engaging with art and communication. Feedback from users will greatly help if our design fails to accomplish these tasks.
