### Problem and Solution Overview
We set out to make museums more accessible-- but for whom? During our research, we learned that WCMA and museums in general are often inaccessible to people of color. We found that the inaccessibility comes from many places: the prioritization of dominant voices and narratives, such as those of the white upper-class, and the simultaneous absence, and even invisibilization, of people of color narratives and experiences in museum curation. These factors contributed to negative emotional experiences and/or intellectual disinterest for our research subjects.

We learned that WCMA is working to specifically address this problem by facilitating discussion with the community. The trouble is that members of the community, including those who might benefit the most from these discussions, are not necessarily aware of these discussions. A second limitation is the fact that the discussions are only available to those who attend, and that the discussions do nothing to benefit visitors *while* they are experiencing the museum.

Thus, our proposed solution is an interactive museum installation that solicits discussion and opinions from visitors while they are in the museum. We want the installation to not only provide concerned visitors with a platform to have their voices heard, but to also archive and display these discussion points in the museum. The goal is for the discussion to happen immediately, and for people's voices to not disappear into the void and instead be heard by the community and centered in the museum experience.

### Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants (Jamie)
We conducted two contextual inquiries and three semi-structured interviews for our [research](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-04-contextual-inquiry-review/). We had no particular selection criteria for our contextual inquiry subjects except that they must not be individuals we know, that being defined as individuals who any of us have had a meal with, and not be identified as "art people." We did this with the hope that our data would reflect the experiences of those for whom the museum might be intellectually inaccessible. Our contextual inquiry subjects, whose names will remain redacted, happened to be people of color. Our three interviewees were all WCMA staff members who hold different titles and perform different roles in the museum.

During our contextual inquiries, we asked about what the subjects were feeling, how they moved through the museum space, and how they go about emotionally, intellectually, and physically engaging with the museum and its objects. Our subjects were both Williams College students and people of color. During our interviews, we asked about our subjects' roles in the museum, where WCMA could be more accessible, and then specifically on the matter of designing museums to be more accessible for people of color. One interviewee went deep into the issue of museum inaccessibility for people of color without being pushed in this direction. Other circumstantial questions were also asked based on how each conversation unfolded.

### Design Research Results and Themes 

[Results and Themes](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-04-contextual-inquiry-review/)

Some of the themes present as we were reviewing our research results were accountability and accessibility for a specific group of people, specifically people of color. There is a need for accountability that has resulted from social distrust of museums. From our affinity diagram, clarity is needed when it comes to labels and audio recordings at museums. Users are categorizing museums as uncomfortable spaces, so there is a need to make museums more comfortable. We also discovered that people are more likely to engage with art if there is a sense of familiarity present or if there is a compelling ambience in an exhibit. From these themes, it became clear to us which tasks our design had to accomplish… help users connect with art by making museums more comfortable and centering narratives of people of color by sharing them or making them more accessible. 


### Answers to Task Analysis Questions 

[Task Analysis](https://museumsforall.github.io/2018-10-04-contextual-inquiry-review/)

Though our design is primarily for people of color, we are trying to make the museum installation accessible to everyone. Based on our contextual inquiries and interviews, we were able to discover that PoC may not feel comfortable in museum spaces because of their inability to relate to artwork lacking PoC representation. Currently, museum visitors engage with art in their own ways. They are able to generate alternative representations and communicate those with people they feel comfortable with. They may also engage in conversations with museum staff about artwork they find intriguing. Some museums also make an effort to hold special discussions for community members. For our museum installation, we want people to share and read alternative interpretations of works that specifically address expressions of power, discomfort, and marginalization in museums. We also want our design to make accessing discussions between museum staff and visitors more accessible. Sharing discussions happening in museums for the wider community is another task we wish to accomplish. We expect these tasks to be performed in museum spaces, where people can interact with art. We also know that discussions can happen outside of museum spaces. People can learn how to complete these tasks through various ways, some of them being their interactions with other museum visitors and exposure to art they can engage with. As of now, people are able to communicate with other museums visitors but we are lacking other tools for expressing how art makes us feel. Our design will enable users to express their opinions and feelings of discomfort more easily which will also be accessible to others. These tasks are meant to be performed while a user is at a museum. If things go wrong in our design, users will resort to the original form of engaging with art and communication. Feedback from users will greatly help if our design fails to accomplish these tasks.

#### An Important Note
There are many different and compounding dimensions of privilege, dimension, and marginalization. Our group has chosen to design museums to be more accessible for people of color specifically. This acknowledges a race-based subjectivity that we hope to center. Still, we acknowledge that for any person, many "isms" may come into play-- racism, heterosexism, ableism, and more. Rather than try to make an ineffective one-size-fits-all solution to these issues, we narrowed our focus based on what was most salient during our research. However, we do hope to at the very least make our design accessible to those with visual impairments, as it is an ethical concern of ours that our technology may not be physically usable to some. We envision our design being able to provide auto-narration of discussion posts so that users who cannot see the text can hear it.
